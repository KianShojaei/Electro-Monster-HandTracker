# Electric Monster - Mouse Tracker

This project utilizes Python, Pygame, and mathematical animations to create an **electric monster** that follows the movements of the mouse cursor on the screen. The program features dynamic animations of tentacles that react to mouse movements, providing an interactive experience.

## Features

- Real-time tracking of mouse movements.
- An electric monster effect that responds to the mouse position.
- Smooth tentacle-like animations using **Pygame**.
- **Fullscreen** mode for an immersive experience.

## Demo

Watch the electric monster in action:

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x**: Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Pygame**: Used for rendering and handling graphics.

### Install Required Dependencies

Use `pip` to install the necessary Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

### Running the Project

**Run the script**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

The program will start, open a fullscreen window, and begin tracking the mouse movements. As you move your mouse cursor, youâ€™ll see a monster-like tentacle animation follow the cursor.

## How It Works

1. **Mouse Tracking**: The program captures mouse motion events to determine the position of the mouse cursor in real-time.
   
2. **Tentacle Animation**: Multiple tentacle-like segments are generated, which follow the mouse's movement. These segments adjust their position and angle to simulate tentacles reaching out to the cursor.

3. **Rendering**: **Pygame** is used for drawing the tentacles and rendering the animations on the screen in real-time.

## Controls

- Move your mouse cursor to control the monster's tentacles.
- Press `close` the window to exit the program.
